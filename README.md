The difference between a Set and a Bag is that Set entriesmust be unique; therefore a slightly different set of public methods isspecified.

Add a main method (inthe Set class or in a separate class) that fully exercises the methods ofSet. One way to do this effectively isto read Strings from a file into a Set (your program source code is a usefulfile for this purpose), then performs various operations (find, remove, etc.)on the Set.
